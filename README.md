# Creating-LVM-Disk-Space-
The goal of this lab is to teach you how to create and manage LVM (Logical Volume Manager) disk space on a virtual machine (VM) instance in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By the end of this lab, you will be able to add additional disks to a VM, set up LVM, and create logical volumes for data storage. 

To understand the use LVM we need to comprehend three main components, they are interconnected and together make what we call a Logical Volume, here are the three components:

	Physical Volume

 	Volume Group

  	Logical Volume
